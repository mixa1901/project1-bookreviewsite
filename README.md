# Project 1

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

A book review website. Users are able to register for your website and then log in using their username and password. Once they log in, they are able to search for books, leave reviews for individual books, and see the reviews made by other people. I used the a third-party API by Goodreads, another book review website, to pull in ratings from a broader audience. Finally, users are able to query for book details and book reviews programmatically via my website’s API.
